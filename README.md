# Vector-Database

A vector database system for storing and managing document chunks with semantic search capabilities.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a REST API that allows users to **index** and **query** their documents within a Vector Database.

A Vector Database specializes in storing and indexing vector embeddings, enabling fast retrieval and similarity searches. This capability is crucial for applications involving natural language processing, recommendation systems, and many moreâ€¦

The API does the following:
1. Allow the users to create, read, update, and delete libraries.
2. Allow the users to create, read, update and delete chunks within a library.
3. Index the contents of a library.
4. Do **k-Nearest Neighbor vector search** over the selected library with a given embedding query.

## Vector Indexes

The system supports three types of vector indexes for efficient similarity search:

1. **Flat Index**
   - Exhaustive search through all vectors
   - Highest accuracy but slower for large datasets
   - Best for small to medium-sized collections

2. **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**
   - Approximate nearest neighbor search
   - Fast and scalable for large datasets
   - Good balance between speed and accuracy
   - Uses graph-based structure for efficient traversal

3. **Inverted File Index**
   - Clusters vectors into cells
   - Fast approximate search
   - Memory-efficient

## API Endpoints
### Libraries

- `POST /library/` - Create a new library
- `GET /library/` - List all libraries
- `GET /library/{library_id}` - Get a specific library
- `PUT /library/{library_id}` - Update a library
- `DELETE /library/{library_id}` - Delete a library

### Documents

- `POST /document/` - Create a new document
- `GET /document/` - List all documents (with optional library filter)
- `GET /document/{document_id}` - Get a specific document
- `PUT /document/{document_id}` - Update a document
- `DELETE /document/{document_id}` - Delete a document

## Data Models

### Library
- LibraryBase
- LibraryCreate

- LibraryResponse

### Document
- DocumentBase
- DocumentCreate
- DocumentUpdate
- DocumentResponse

### Chunk

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vector-db.git
cd vector-db
```

2. Create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```
Required environment variables in `.env`:
```env
COHERE_API_KEY=""
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongodb:27017/
MONGODB_DB=vector_db
```
1. Build and start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`


### Docker Compose Services

The application uses the following services:

- **vector-db**: The main FastAPI application
- **mongodb**: MongoDB database for storing documents, chunks, and their embeddings
